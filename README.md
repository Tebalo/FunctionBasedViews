# FunctionBasedViews
 Django has two types of views; function-based views (FBVs), and class-based views (CBVs). ... The classes have documentation on Django's project site that shows what functionality is offered, what settings are required or possible, and how to extend them.
How INSTALL and RUN:
cd mysite
pipenv shell
pipenv install django
cd mysite
python manage.py runserver
